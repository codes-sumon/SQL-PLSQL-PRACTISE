1.
SELECT job_id, count(employee_id) Number_of_People
FROM employees
GROUP BY job_id;

2.


SELECT e.last_name, e.job_id,e.department_id,d.department_name
FROM employees e JOIN departments d
ON( e.department_id=d.department_id)
JOIN locations l
ON(l.location_id=d.location_id)
WHERE l.city = 'Toronto';

3.
SELECT last_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE manager_id IN (SELECT employee_id FROM employees Where last_name = 'King');

4.
SELECT e.last_name, e.department_id, e.job_id
FROM employees e JOIN departments d
ON( e.department_id=d.department_id)
WHERE d.location_id= 1700;

SELECT DISTINCT job_id
FROM employees;

DECLARE

  SELECT ROWNUM, EMPLOYEE_ID, LAST_NAME FROM EMPLOYEES;
  --V_EMP EMP_CUR%ROWTYPE;
  
BEGIN
  FOR EMP IN EMP_CUR LOOP
   DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(EMP.ROWNUM||' '||EMP.LAST_NAME||' '||EMP.EMPLOYEE_ID);
  END LOOP;
END;

DECLARE
